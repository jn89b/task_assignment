# Task 2: Simple Path planning
- Your next task will be to read and do research on Djikstra's and Astar 
- From your research you should understand the similiarities and differences between these two algorithms 
- Heres a couple of good links to get you started, you're free to look at other sources:

## Task Assignment
- With whatever program language you decide to choose code the Djikstra's algorithm and demonstrate that it works in the following scenario: 
  - **Agent starts at 0,0**
  - **Agent's goal is 19,19**
  - Agent is in a grid that is 20 x 20 
  - Obstacles are set at coordinates:
    - 5,5
    - 5,6
    - 5,7
    - 10,12
    - 9,12
    - 8,12
    - 7,12
  - Do not worry about collision bubbles 
  - In addition the agent is constrained within the 20 x 20 grid which means it cannot go outside the boundary of this world 

## Deliverables 
- Show a plot that contains:
  - The path of the agent from start to goal
  - The obstacles in the grid area
- Source code:
  - Doesn't have to be clean but please push commits to keep track of progress or if you need help
